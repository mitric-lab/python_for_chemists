# Eigenvalues and Singular Values

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices represent one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, with profound applications extending far beyond linear algebra into quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, and data analysis. These eigenvalue problems emerge naturally across diverse scientific contexts: when analyzing the vibrational modes of molecules, determining the electronic structure of chemical systems, or identifying the principal components that capture the most variation in complex datasets.

The power of eigenvalues and eigenvectors lies in their ability to decompose any diagonalizable matrix into a product of three matrices: $\bm{A} = \bm{Q} \bm{\Lambda} \bm{Q}^{-1}$, where $\bm{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and $\bm{Q}$ contains the corresponding eigenvectors as columns. This representation, known as the *Eigenvalue Decomposition* (EVD), reveals the fundamental structure underlying the matrix transformation.

While the EVD applies only to square matrices, the *Singular Value Decomposition* (SVD) extends this powerful concept to matrices of arbitrary dimensions. For any matrix $\bm{A}$, the SVD provides the factorization $\bm{A} = \bm{U} \bm{\Sigma} \bm{V}^\intercal$, where $\bm{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$ are orthogonal matrices. This generalization makes the SVD applicable to a much broader range of problems in science and engineering.

Both EVD and SVD serve as indispensable tools for matrix analysis, with applications spanning quantum chemistry, spectroscopic data analysis, and computational modeling. Moreover, they form the mathematical foundation for many essential algorithms in machine learning and data science, enabling us to extract meaningful patterns and insights from complex datasets. In this chapter, we will explore both decompositions in detail, examining their theoretical foundations and demonstrating their practical significance in quantum chemistry, data analysis, and machine learning applications.
