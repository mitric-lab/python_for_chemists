# Regression Analysis

A very common task in data analysis is to fit a model to a set of data. 
This is called regression analysis, a foundational statistical tool that 
uncovers the relationships between variables in countless scientific 
inquiries, including those in chemistry.

Consider the following practical examples: applying the Lambert-Beer law 
to quantify the concentration of a solution based on light absorption, 
determining the effect of temperature on reaction rates, understanding the 
relationship between substrate concentration and enzyme activity. 
Each of these examples showcases how regression analysis aids in modeling 
experimental data, extracting relationships between variables, and making
predictions. 

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of regression analysis,
starting with simple linear regression and moving on to more complex
models. We will also delve into the underlying optimisation algorithms
used to fit these models to data. Furthermore, we will discuss the
importance of model evaluation and regularisation techniques to prevent
overfitting.
