# Regression Analysis

Have you ever been asked to draw the "best" straight line through a scatter plot of data points? This common task is a simple example of a powerful statistical technique called **Regression Analysis**. It's a fundamental method used across sciences, including chemistry, to identify, model, and understand the relationships between different variables.

Think about common scenarios in chemistry: using Lambert-Beer's law to relate absorbance to concentration, studying how temperature affects reaction rates, or modeling enzyme activity based on substrate concentration. Regression analysis provides the mathematical framework to describe these relationships, allowing us to quantify connections and make predictions.

This chapter introduces the core concepts and their implementation in Python:
*   **Least Squares:** Introduces the core mathematical principle of minimizing squared errors for best fit.
*   **Linear Regression:** Applies least squares to fit straight lines (e.g., Lambert-Beer law) and introduces basic Python/NumPy data handling and Matplotlib plotting.
*   **Numerical Optimization:** Covers iterative methods (gradient descent, SciPy) for finding parameters when formulas are complex, applied back to the linear model.
*   **Nonlinear Regression:** Extends the methods to model non-linear systems (e.g., kinetics, titrations) using numerical optimization.

Let's begin by exploring how we define and find that "best" fit.
