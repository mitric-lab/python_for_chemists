# Regression Analysis

A very common task in data analysis is to fit a model to a data set. This is 
called regression analysis, a fundamental statistical tool in countless 
scientific studies, including chemistry, which reveals the relationships 
between variables.

Consider the following practical examples: Applying Lambert-Beer's law to 
quantify the concentration of a solution based on light absorption, 
determining the effect of temperature on reaction rates, figuring out 
the relationship between substrate concentration and enzyme activity. 
Each of these examples shows how regression analysis helps to model 
experimental data, extract relationships between variables and make 
predictions.

In this chapter, we will look at the basics of regression analysis, 
from simple linear regression to more complex models. We will also look at 
the underlying optimisation algorithms used to fit these models to the data. 
In addition, we will discuss the importance of model evaluation and 
regularisation techniques to avoid overfitting.
