# Vorwort

**WARNING: Translate and adapt!**

Dear Students,

Welcome to the programming course in theoretical chemistry.
This class builds on the bachelor lecture 
"Programming Course for Chemists" and assumes that you are already
familiar with the basic principles of Python and the numerical 
algorithms explained there. 

According to current planning, the lecture will take place on
- every Monday from 10:15 to 11:45 

and
- every Thursday from 12:15 to 13:45. 

## Syllabus 

A preliminary syllabus is shown below. This can and will be continuously 
updated throughout the semester according to the progress of the lecture.
